Description: Voice-over-IP server for ham radio operators
 The SvxLink server provides access to a ham radio transceiver via
 the EchoLink® protocol.
 .
 EchoLink® allows licensed amateur radio operators to communicate
 over the Internet, including remote access to station equipment.
 The server can act as a repeater controller or operate on a simplex
 channel. Based on a modular design, the server can be configured to
 provide voice mail and echo (talkback) service.
 .
 svxlink-server is normally used together with the 'remotetrx'
 package, which allows the remote control of a radio transceiver.
 .
 For a client program implementing the EchoLink® protocol, please
 have a look at the 'qtel' package.
 .
 This package contains the SvxLink server.
