Description: Voice-over-IP server for ham radio operators
 The SvxLink server provides access to a ham radio transceiver via
 the EchoLink® protocol. It can act as a repeater controller
 or operate on a simplex channel. Based on a modular design, the server
 can be configured to provide voice mail and echo (talkback) service.
 It is normally used together with the 'remotetrx' package, which allows
 the remote control of a radio transceiver.
 .
 For a client program implementing the EchoLink® protocol, please
 have a look at the 'qtel' package.
